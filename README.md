Repository for the DataBase project A.Y. 2022/2023 by the group composed of Ciaravola Giosu√©, Bruno Salvatore, Della Corte Mario, Esposito Maurizio, concerning the development of a database for managing KPIs for the Zalando newsletter.

- The final report in which all the choices made and the detailed design are illustrated.
